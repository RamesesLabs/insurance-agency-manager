### Introduction

Laravel Boilerplate provided us with a massive head start on this medium sized web application. It came with a full featured access control system & API which we tailored to better suit an insurance agency that sells policie from a variety of insurance providers. Built on a Bootstrap foundation with a front and backend architecture. A lot of work has been put into the project so we hope that everyone that uses it will contribute back to both this and the laravel-boilerplate repository.
